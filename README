My Build of Suckless's dwm.

I comment wherever possible the purpose of variables, functions, macros etc.

Bindings can be figured out from config.h file.

Features
--------

This build can spawn scatchpads as well as bc in a scratchpad, swallow windows, make a window sticky, send a client to another tag while following and not following it, move items around the stack and be configured by xresources.
